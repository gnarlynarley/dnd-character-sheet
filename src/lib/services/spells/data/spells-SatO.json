Within that area, portals close and can't be opened for the duration. Spells and other effects that allow planar travel or open portals, such as gate or plane shift, fail if used to enter or leave the area. The cube is stationary.\n"},{"id":"Warp Sense|SatO","name":"Warp Sense","source":"SatO","level":2,"range":"self","classes":["sorcerer","warlock","wizard","sorcerer","warlock","wizard"],"description":"For the duration, you sense the presence of portals, even inactive ones, within 30 feet of yourself.\n\nIf you detect a portal in this way, you can use your action to study it. Make a 15 ability check using your spellcasting ability. On a successful check, you learn the destination plane of the portal and what portal key it requires, then the spell ends. On a failed check, you learn nothing and can't study that portal again using this spell until you cast it again.\n\nThe spell can penetrate most barriers but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.\n"}]
