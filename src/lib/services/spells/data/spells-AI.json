Do you need to downplay the worth of some magical assets when the tax collector stops by? Distort value has you covered.\n\nYou cast this spell on an object no more than 1 foot on a side, doubling the object's perceived value by adding illusory flourishes or polish to it, or reducing its perceived value by half with the help of illusory scratches, dents, and other unsightly features. Anyone examining the object can ascertain its true value with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.\n"},{"id":"Fast Friends|AI","name":"Fast Friends","source":"AI","level":3,"range":"30 feet","classes":["bard","cleric","wizard","bard","cleric","wizard"],"description":"When you need to make sure something gets done, you can't rely on vague promises, sworn oaths, or binding contracts of employment. When you cast this spell, choose one humanoid within range that can see and hear you, and that can understand you. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed in this way, it undertakes to perform any services or activities you ask of it in a friendly manner, to the best of its ability.\n\nYou can set the creature new tasks when a previous task is completed, or if you decide to end its current task. If the service or activity might cause harm to the creature, or if it conflicts with the creature's normal activities and desires, the creature can make another Wisdom saving throw to try to end the effect. This save is made with advantage if you or your companions are fighting the creature. If the activity would result in certain death for the creature, the spell ends.\n\nWhen the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.\n"},{"id":"Gift of Gab|AI","name":"Gift of Gab","source":"AI","level":2,"range":"self","classes":["bard","wizard","bard","wizard"],"description":"> When I met Jim Darkmagic, I wondered how he got anything done in that outfit. I have since learned that most of his talents involve standing and talking. His outfit is perfect for that.\n\n> Môrgæn\n\nJim Darkmagic is said to have invented this spell, originally calling it I said what?! Have you ever been talking to the local monarch and accidentally mentioned how their son looks like your favorite hog from when you were growing up on the family farm? We've all been there! But rather than being beheaded for an honest slip of the tongue, you can pretend it never happened—by ensuring that no one knows it happened.\n\nWhen you cast this spell, you skillfully reshape the memories of listeners in your immediate area, so that each creature of your choice within 5 feet of you forgets everything you said within the last 6 seconds. Those creatures then remember that you actually said the words you speak as the verbal component of the spell.\n"},{"id":"Incite Greed|AI","name":"Incite Greed","source":"AI","level":3,"range":"30 feet","classes":["cleric","wizard","warlock","cleric","wizard","warlock"],"description":"When you cast this spell, you present the gem used as the material component and choose any number of creatures within range that can see you. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the spell ends, or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. While charmed in this way, a creature can do nothing but use its movement to approach you in a safe manner. While an affected creature is within 5 feet of you, it cannot move, but simply stares greedily at the gem you present.\n\nAt the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.\n"},{"id":"Jim's Glowing Coin|AI","name":"Jim's Glowing Coin","source":"AI","level":2,"range":"60 feet","classes":["wizard","wizard"],"description":"Of the many tactics employed by master magician and renowned adventurer Jim Darkmagic, the old glowing coin trick is a time-honored classic. When you cast the spell, you hurl the coin that is the spell's material component to any spot within range. The coin lights up as if under the effect of a light spell. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the coin must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be distracted for the duration. While distracted, a creature has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and initiative rolls.\n"},{"id":"Jim's Magic Missile|AI","name":"Jim's Magic Missile","source":"AI","level":1,"range":"120 feet","classes":["wizard","wizard"],"description":"> Jim's magic missile is an ancient and powerful spell, as well as being the name of my band in Wizard Academy.\n\n> Jim Darkmagic\n\nAny apprentice wizard can cast a boring old magic missile. Sure, it always strikes its target. Yawn. Do away with the drudgery of your grandfather's magic with this improved version of the spell, as used by Jim Darkmagic!\n\nYou create three twisting, whistling, hypoallergenic, gluten-free darts of magical force. Each dart targets a creature of your choice that you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack for each missile. On a hit, a missile deals 2d4 force damage to its target.\n\nIf the attack roll scores a critical hit, the target of that missile takes 5d4 force damage instead of you rolling damage twice for a critical hit. If the attack roll for any missile is a 1, all missiles miss their targets and blow up in your face, dealing 1 force damage per missile to you.\n"},{"id":"Motivational Speech|AI","name":"Motivational Speech","source":"AI","level":3,"range":"60 feet","classes":["bard","cleric","bard","cleric"],"description":"> I once heard a motivational speech by Jim and it was the worst ninety seconds of my life.

If an affected creature is hit by an attack, it has advantage on the next attack roll it makes. Once an affected creature loses the temporary hit points granted by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.\n"}]
